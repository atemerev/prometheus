 * // todo rewrite comments
 * A support class for appending continuations to promises. After the promise is fulfilled (i.e. its underlying
 * future task is done), continuation execution is started by fire() method. The result of promise execution is
 * accessible within the caller's scope.
 * <p/>
 * Continuations can be chained. This will inevitably lead you to the Haskell hell with all its monads, so be
 * warned.
