/**
 * A <code>Promise</code> is generally a <code>Future</code> with support for appending continuations.
 * A continuation is an action which will be executed at the moment the <code>Future</code> completes. This action
 * can itself be a <code>Promise</code>, so they can be chained.
 * <p/>
 * <code>Promise&lt;Void&gt;</code> form is also common -- it provides a convenient way to check for completion of
 * some action (presumably running in a different thread) without caring for it's returned result.
 * <p/>
 * As an additional bonus, a <code>Promise</code> can accept message listeners. It will fire
 * <code>CancelledEvent</code> when task is cancelled and <code>CompletedEvent</code> when task is done. During
 * the execution progress, other messages can be fired and delivered to listeners.
